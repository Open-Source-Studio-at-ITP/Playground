# Code of Conduct 

(Should we use a template or write one from scratch?)

1. (Should we only provide technical guidelines or include rules in concept as mentioned in What does "Open Source Even Mean"?)
2. I think the Recurse Center's code of conduct would be a good reference if we decide to write our own: https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct
