# Code of Conduct

1. (Should we only provide technical guidelines or include rules in concept as mentioned in What does "Open Source Even Mean"?)
2. I think the Recurse Center's code of conduct would be a good reference if we decide to write our own: https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct
3. In service of reuse, I think we should build upon what others have already done.. https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-forum-code-of-conduct/
4. Is it acceptable to work on this during class?


If we were to write our own, below is a potential structure (based on the [Contributor Covenant's Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.txt)):
